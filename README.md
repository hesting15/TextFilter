# TextFilter

Use this application if you need to quickly filter text.
For example I do not remember all linux commands, but I can quickly find them:

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22618607/28619107-8c1cc860-720f-11e7-84aa-4ecc2a184edc.gif)

Features:
- Use `Ctrl+F` to start filtering
- Press `Enter` to go to the line in original text
- Use `Ctrl+Left Mouse` click to copy whole line to the clipboard
- Use fuzzy search to filter text (e.g. `ore psu` will find `Lorem Ipsum`)
- Press `Alt+C` several times to extend selection and copy multiple lines to clipboard

Application is written in `Qt Creator`
